Most people mock chiropractors saying they are not \"real doctors\". However, chiropractors, like medical doctors, undergo an uncompromising education in the medical sciences. In areas like anatomy, physiology, rehabilitation, nutrition, and public health, they receive a more intensive, hands-on education than their MD counterparts. A typical applicant at a chiropractic college has already acquired around 4 years of pre-medical education including courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and psychology. After joining a chiropractic college, the requirements become even more demanding. 4-5 years of professional study are the standard and due to the hands-on nature of chiropractic, a significant portion of time is spent in clinical training.\n                </Typography>\n              </div>\n            </Grid>\n            <Grid item xs={12} sm={4}>\n              <div className={classes.feature}>\n                <FeatureCardMedicine />\n              </div>\n            </Grid>\n            <Grid item xs={12} sm={4}>\n              <div className={classes.feature}>\n                <FeatureCardPain/>\n              </div>\n            </Grid>\n            <Grid item xs={12} sm={4}>\n              <div className={classes.feature}>\n                <FeatureCardBrain/>\n              </div>\n            </Grid>\n            <Grid item xs={12} sm={4}>\n              <div className={classes.feature}>\n                <img src={painimg2} height=\"256\" width=\"256\" alt=\"Backache\" />\n              </div>\n            </Grid>\n            <Grid item xs={12} sm={8}>\n              <h3 className={classes.subheading}>\n                What causes back pain?\n              </h3>\n              <Typography component=\"p\" align=\"justify\" className={classes.bodytext2}>\n                The spine is made up of vertebrae extending from the skull and ending at the sacrum. Cervical discs are present in between to absorb shocks. Inflammation or injury in the spinal joints, muscles, discs or nerves can cause back pain or stiffness. Examples of common conditions causing back pain are herniated or slipped discs, bulging discs, degenerated disc disease, a pinched nerve, or injuries/strain.\n              </Typography><br/>\n              <Typography component=\"p\" align=\"justify\" className={classes.bodytext2}>\n                Generally, drugs taken to cure back pain are drugs like Tylenol (acetaminophen) or Advil (Ibuprofen). However, these come with side effects like nausea, stomach pain, itching, rash, dark urine, etc.\n              </Typography>\n            </Grid>\n            <Grid item xs={12} sm={4}>\n              <div className={classes.feature}>\n                <img src={painimg1} height=\"256\" width=\"256\" alt=\"Backache treatment\" />\n              </div>\n            </Grid>\n            <Grid item xs={12} sm={8}>\n              <h3 className={classes.subheading}>\n                Treating back pain\n              </h3>\n              <Typography component=\"p\" align=\"justify\" className={classes.bodytext2}>\n                Chiropractic usually focuses on spinal adjustment and manipulation to reduce pain and helps stimulate the bodyâ€™s self-healing abilities. Realignment of the spine reduces the pressure on the central nervous system.  Along with reducing pain, chiropractic treatment will also help to increase the range of motion of the affected area and make everyday tasks smooth and pain-free.\n              </Typography>\n              <br/>\n              <Typography component=\"p\" align=\"justify\" className={classes.bodytext2}>\n                Chiropractic might appear as pseudoscience to many, however, there is sound research-backed support for chiropractic treatment for lower back pain.
